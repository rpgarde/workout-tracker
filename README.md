If you want to run this locally on your machine:

## Usage
See deployed app [here](https://dry-basin-79854.herokuapp.com/)

1. If there is an existing workout, you can either add exercises to it (by pressing Continue) or create a new workout altogether
2. When you are adding exercises, you can either choose cardio / resistance training
3. Once you submit your exercise, you can either add more exercises, complete your workout
4. Once you complete your workout, you will be taken to a summary page summarising your last workout
5. You can also click to the Stats page and be taken to a page with two graphs, summarising workout duration and weight lifted over the past 7 workouts

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.

## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to the most recent workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.

  * View the total duration of each workout from the past seven workouts on the `stats` page.
